note on testing ccrypt

use:
$ ccrypt -e file-to-encrypt

= then it prompts for the key, then modify the file to file.cpt

$ ccrypt -d file-to-decrypt
= then prompts for key, then mod the file back to its original, 
says: file-to-encrypt

can use the key file too such:

$ ccrypt -e file-to-encrypt -k key-file

same as decrypt

! but it is like a symetric encryption, must use same key 
for both ways, and it not read the whole private key 
but just the first line of the keyfile.


so, good and easy for symetric method.
